## 🔮 Summary
SimWork delivers an AI-driven, immersive "future of work" game that combines real-world tasks with adaptive difficulty, OCR-enabled asset submission, and real-time analytics. It scales from single learners to enterprise hires, offering both hiring managers and trainees a seamless, data-rich experience that reduces mis-hires and accelerates workforce readiness.

## 🔍 Problem/Opportunity
- **Wrong Hires, Wasted Money**: Companies keep hiring the wrong people—time, salary, and training costs wasted
- **Fake Skills, No Real Test**: Many hires pass interviews but fail on the job
- **Slow, Inefficient Hiring Process**: Too many rounds, test sheets, and guesswork
- **No KPI or Proof of Skill**: Current systems don't track real performance

## 💡 Solution
- **Immersive, Multi-Role Game World**: 3D office/map with stations for Developer, Designer, PM, Data Entry, and AI Engineer roles
- **AI-Powered Adaptivity & Agents**: Integrated GPT-based agents guide scenarios and dynamically adjust task complexity
- **Real-Time Analytics & Feedback**: Dashboard tracks KPIs (accuracy, speed, decision quality)
